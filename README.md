# One-Day-Tour-Planning-Application
This is an assignment project on One-Day Tour Planning Assistant for Attentions.AI

# Project Description
This project is a comprehensive one-day tour planning assistant designed to help users create tailored plans for exploring a city based on their specific preferences and constraints. The system allows users to interact through a chat interface, inputting their requirements for a day trip, such as the city to visit, available timings, budget, and interests (e.g., culture, adventure, food, shopping). The goal is to provide a personalized and dynamic itinerary that adjusts seamlessly based on user interactions and evolving preferences.
